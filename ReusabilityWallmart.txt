Why we need it

Problem:
- Efficiency
- Managing Dependency is Hell ( we need to keep up all )

Electrode.io is open-source framework of wallmart

Wall Mart use Archetypes = Component Templates which have all dependency , 

people, just select Archetypes only, no nedd to select in depth dependency themself


Way of build component must have consistency ......
- Select Archetype => as base
- Select CSS file  => to make it look different , even on the same Archetype

Meta Team : Is senior representative for discussion & communication

Proposal Process : Use github for each Team to propose to create component

Discovery : Electrode Explore for easy to search of each component , showcase, demos , 

Every compenent need unit test

CI/CD ( when change component, need automatically update component, run auto test & feedback, before send to 
meta team )   < Check, Check, Check >
