Why we need it

Electrode.io is open-source framework of wallmart

Wall Mart use Archetypes = Component Templates which have all dependency , 

people, just select Archetypes only, no nedd to select in depth dependency themself


Way of build component must have consistency ......
- Select Archetype => as base
- Select CSS file  => to make it look different , even on the same Archetype

Meta Team : Is senior representative for discussion & communication




Managing Dependency is Hell ( we need to keep up all )
